# Sorting Visualizer

An interactive web-based **Sorting Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to help understand how popular sorting algorithms work internally.  
The application visually demonstrates the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms using animated bars whose heights represent array values.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generate a **new random array** dynamically
- Adjust **array size** using a slider
- Control **animation speed** using a speed slider
- Visualize the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Clean and simple UI with smooth animations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the web application  
- **CSS** – Styling, layout, and visual appearance  
- **JavaScript** – Core logic, animations, and sorting algorithms

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each bar represents an element of the array.
- The height of a bar corresponds to the value of that element.
- When a sorting algorithm is selected, the algorithm runs step-by-step.
- During sorting:
  - Bars are compared and swapped visually.
  - Animation speed is controlled by the speed slider.
- A new random array can be generated at any time using the **New Array** button.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Adjust the **array size** and **speed** as required.
4. Select a sorting algorithm to visualize.

_No additional libraries or installations are required._

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helps in:
- Understanding how different sorting algorithms work internally
- Visualizing time complexity differences intuitively
- Improving JavaScript DOM manipulation and animation skills

---

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add color indicators for comparisons and swaps
- Display time and space complexity for each algorithm
- Add pause/resume functionality
- Improve responsiveness for smaller screens
